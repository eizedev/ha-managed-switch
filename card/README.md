A dashboard card that draws your **managed switches** like their own web interface: every port
coloured by link and speed, uplinks to other switches, trunk members, PoE delivering power, and
the device connected to each port. It shows what the
[Managed Switch (SNMP)](https://github.com/eizedev/ha-managed-switch) integration reads.
